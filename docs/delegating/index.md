# Delegating TRST

**Documentation for delegating TRST.**

Delegating TRST works in the same way like other Cosmos-based blockchains. Delegate your 'stake' to valitors using a wallet, like the [Keplr wallet](https://faq.keplr.app/), or alternatively you can use the Trustless Hub daemon. This process is similar accross Cosmos-based blockchains.



**Background**

In simple terms, TRST can be used to earn through staking or through transacting with the blockchain. On the ‘staking’ side, users lock up their tokens, and automatically earn rewards. On the ‘transaction’ side, users can earn TRST by estimating items. On this side, users can also buy items and trade TRST for other tokens and vice versa.

By staking TRST, token holders delegate their TRST to validators and earn inflation rewards. 

## Using Trustless Hub Interact

Go to [Interact.Trustlesshub.com](https://interact.trustlesshub.com/).
Log in through Keplr (preferred way), alternatively you can create a new address here, or log in with a Ledger device.

Then  select 'Validators' in the menu. Here you can view all of the active validators on the Hub. Select one and click on Delegate. 
Here it is important to not delegate all of your TRST. Leave a small portion of your balance to pay for transaction costs, these are needed to undelegate your TRST.
The lockup period is determined by governance, and is set to 14 days on default.

## Using the daemon

First, install the [daemon](https://docs.trustlesshub.com/guide/install.html). 

Then run it on mainnet. 

Then delegate your tokens.
