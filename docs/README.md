# The Trustless Hub

[The Trustless Hub](https://github.com/trstlabs/trst) is a private smart contract hub within the Cosmos ecosystem. Here you can build and deploy Trustless Contracts to a large decentralized worldwide community. The Trustless Hub is built on top of the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network), the world’s most popular blockchain framework. Trustless Hub enables new services using private inputs, automated messages and verifiable outcomes.
Additionally, any unique asset can be exchanged for TRST with independent prices. Anything can be transferred in a fast, secure and trustless way.

## What is TRST?

TRST is the native token of the Trustless Hub and is used to pay for gas fees. It is used for:

* Transactions
* Storing, instantiating and executing Trustless Contracts. 
* Estimating and transacting with unique assets. 

You can also stake your TRSt by delegating your TRST to validators. Trough governance, you can vote on important proposals such as upgrades and parameter changes. 


## Why Trustless Contracts?
The Trustless Hub aims to be the most innovative smart contract platform across all blockchains. The Trustless Hub enables smart contracts 2.0, called Trustless Contracts. Developers will be able to use and integrate Trustless Contracts for services and use-cases that are currently not possible. Many of use-cases are related to NFTs, pricing and billing, yet this can be for anything.


There are 4 pillars to Trustless Contracts:
1. Private inputs
2. Secure execution (using Intel SGX Secure enclaves)
3. Automatic result generation and finalization
4. Verifiable outcomes

Any CosmWasm code, like a smart contracts on Terra and Secret Contracts on the Secret Network can easily be transformed into a Trustless Contract.

New trustless services are now possible, like auto-ending private auctions. CosmWasm smart contracts are present in major Cosmos-based blockchains like Terra, Crypto.com, Secret Network and Irisnet, and allow for developers to easily create smart contracts in the same way across different blockchains. For example, if a developer learns to program on Terra, creating Trustless Contracts on the Trustless Hub is as simple as ABC. A developer can reuse the code, enjoy private computing or add time-dependent functions. Cryptocurrencies like Terra’s stablecoin UST can be transferred onto any Trustless Contract using IBC, making the switch a breeze. If you’re unfamiliar with CosmWasm, there are many [tutorials out there](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=CosmWasm).
By deploying [Cosmwasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) code, you can use Trustless Contracts for:

Use cases that leverage private inputs and automatic, verifiable outcomes are now possible on the Trustless Hub, such as:
Trustless data aggregation
Auto-ending secret bid auctions 
Estimation aggregation for generating independent prices
Automatic private transaction relayers
Conditional token and NFT transfers

## Using BFT consensus and Cosmos SDK

Many projects already showcase the Tendermint BFT consensus engine and the Cosmos SDK. Explore the [Cosmos Network Ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps) to discover a wide variety of apps, blockchains, wallets, and explorers that are built in the Cosmos ecosystem.
