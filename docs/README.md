# Trustless Hub

Trustless Hub is an application-specific blockchain built for automatic execution.

Trustless Hub allows developers and end-users to automate arbitrary Cosmos messages. Building and interacting with complex automation solutions is also possible. You can build and deploy Self-Executing Smart Contracts to a large decentralized worldwide community.

Trustless Hub is built on the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network), and CosmWasm - Wasm-compiled Rust smart contracts, used by many Cosmos SDK Chains. CosmWasm Smart contracts are safer and more effient compared to other smart contracts.

Trustless Hub enables new services using time-based execution and verifiable data to create seamless user experiences.

Use-cases include ecurring transactions for paying in installments, remittances and payroll. Protocols can automate their workflows in a reliable and easy to integate manner. Devlopers can build dApps that use recurring swaps and automatic reward claiming. In-game battles are made more fun with time-based winner appointment. 

Any protocol with access to Inter-Blockchain communication, like smart contracts on Juno, Osmosis, Secret Network and Archway can extend their functionality through Trustless Hub.

## Use Cases

 1. DeFi
 2. Payments
 3. Gaming

Developers on other Chains and contract platforms will be able to use and integrate Trustless Hub's on-chain automation. DAOs can use payroll services, NFT creators can build in time-based minting and subscriptions. Games can do in-game battles with time-based battles and automatic winner appointment.

In the Use Case section we'll dive more into each of these!

## TRST Token

TRST is the native token of Trustless Hub and is used for:

* Automatic execution of smart contract
* Storing, instantiating and executing Contracts
* General transaction fees

You can also stake your TRST by delegating your TRST to validators. On-chain governance through TRST is to keep the chain secure through economic costs. Yoiu vote on important proposals such as chain upgrades, fees, incentives and parameter changes.

## Using BFT consensus and Cosmos SDK

Many projects already showcase the Tendermint BFT consensus engine and the Cosmos SDK. Explore the [Cosmos Network Ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps) to discover a wide variety of apps, blockchains, wallets, and explorers that are built in the Cosmos ecosystem.

## Applications built with Trustless Hub

* [Interact - Wallet](https://interact.trustlesshub.com)
* CosmoPortal - DEX Aggregator & Payments (alpha)
