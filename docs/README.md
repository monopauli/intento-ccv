# Trustless Hub

Trustless Hub is an application-specific blockchain built for automatic execution of on-chain transactions and workflows.

Trustless Hub allows developers and end-users to automate transactions and messages in the Cosmos Ecosystem. Building and interacting with complex automation solutions is also possible. You can build and deploy Self-Executing Smart Contracts using our CosmWasm enginge optimized for automatic exection.

Trustless Hub is built on the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network), and CosmWasm - Wasm-compiled Rust smart contracts, used by many Cosmos SDK Chains. CosmWasm smart contracts can be built safer and more efficient compared to other smart contracts.

Trustless Hub enables new services using time-based execution and verifiable data to create seamless user experiences.

Use-cases include ecurring transactions for paying in installments, remittances and payroll. Protocols can automate their workflows in a reliable and easy-to-integate manner. Developers can build dApps that use recurring swaps and automatic reward claiming. In-game battles are made more fun with time-based winner appointment. 

Any protocol with access to Inter-Blockchain communication, like smart contracts on Juno, Osmosis, Secret Network and Archway can extend their functionality through Trustless Hub.

## Use Cases

 1. DeFi
 2. Payments
 3. Gaming

Developers on other Chains and contract platforms will be able to use and integrate Trustless Hub's on-chain automation. DAOs can use payroll services, NFT creators can integrate time-based minting and subscription models. On-chain subscription models are also a great way for content creators and website owners to grant accounts access and earn continuous revenue. Games can build in exciting in-game battles with time-based battles and automatic winner appointment.

In the Use Case section we'll dive more into each of these!

## TRST Token

TRST is the native token of Trustless Hub and is used for:

* Automatic execution of smart contract
* Storing, instantiating and executing Contracts
* General transaction fees

You can also stake your TRST by delegating your TRST to validators. You can vote on important proposals such as chain upgrades, fees, incentives and parameter changes.

## Using BFT consensus and Cosmos SDK

Many projects already showcase the Tendermint BFT consensus engine and the Cosmos SDK. Explore the [Cosmos Network Ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps) to discover a wide variety of apps, blockchains, wallets, and explorers that are built in the Cosmos ecosystem.

## Applications built with Trustless Hub

* [Interact - Wallet](https://interact.trustlesshub.com)
* CosmoPortal - DEX Aggregator & Payments (alpha)
