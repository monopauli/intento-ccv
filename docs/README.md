# Trustless Hub

[The Trustless Hub](https://github.com/danieljdd/trst) is a zone on the Cosmos hub where you can build and deploy Trustless Contracts to a decentralized worldwide community. Trustless Hub is built on top of the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network), the world’s most popular blockchain framework. Trustless Hub enables new services using trustless data aggregation and tokenization of independently priced items. Trustless Contracts enable trustless applications through private contracts with time-dependent functions. Assets can be exchanged for TRST tokens with independent prices on Trustless Transfers. Anything can be transferred in a fast, secure and trustless way.

## What is TRST?

TRST is the native token of the Trustless Hub and is used to pay for gas fees. It is used for:

* Transactions
* Storing, instantiating and executing Trustless Contracts. 
* Estimating and transacting assets. 

You can also stake your tokens by delegating your tokens to validators. Trough governance, you can vote on important proposals such as upgrades and parameter changes. 


## Why Trustless Contracts?
Trustless Contracts on Trustless Hub are secure, private and self-deleting CosmWasm smart contracts, with support for functions that execute over time. With these contracts, users can trust that their input is handled privately and know when the contract ends and what happens when the contract ends.
* Encrypted inputs ensure privacy of all users
* Time-dependent functions enable automatic outcomes
* Self-ending contracts give confidence to all stakeholders

New trustless services are now possible, like auto-ending private auctions. CosmWasm smart contracts are present in major Cosmos-based blockchains like Terra, Crypto.com, Secret Network and Irisnet, and allow for developers to easily create smart contracts in the same way across different blockchains. For example, if a developer learns to program on Terra, creating Trustless Contracts on Trust Price Protocol is as simple as ABC. A developer can reuse the code, enjoy private computing or add time-dependent functions. Cryptocurrencies like Terra’s stablecoin UST can be transferred onto any Trustless Contract using IBC, making the switch a breeze. If you’re unfamiliar with CosmWasm, there are many [tutorials out there](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=CosmWasm).
By deploying [Cosmwasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) code, you can use Trustless Contracts for:

* Trustless data aggregation (data remains private, only result is calculated)
* Private sealed bid auctions (biddings unknown to all, ending at specific time)
* Conditional transfer contracts (at a certain date and when it meets certain conditions)

… And beyond 


## Using BFT consensus and Cosmos SDK

Many projects already showcase the Tendermint BFT consensus engine and the Cosmos SDK. Explore the [Cosmos Network Ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps) to discover a wide variety of apps, blockchains, wallets, and explorers that are built in the Cosmos ecosystem.
