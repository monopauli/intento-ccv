# Trustless Hub

Trustless Hub is an application-specific blockchain built for automatic execution of on-chain transactions and workflows.

Automating tasks has become increasingly essential in our fast-paced world, and blockchain technology has proven to be a valuable tool for achieving this. 

One significant benefit of automation on-chain is the ability to create simple triggers for recurring transactions, making tasks like paying in installments, remittances, and payroll much more efficient. 

However, the potential of blockchain automation extends far beyond these basic tasks. With the use of Trustless Contracts, complex workflows can be automated reliably and easily integrated into existing decentralized apps (dApps). This flexibility also allows developers to create dApps that use recurring swaps and automatic reward claiming, further streamlining processes. Even in the world of gaming, on-chain automation has a role to play, with time-based winner appointments adding an exciting new dimension to in-game battles. The possibilities for on-chain automation are virtually limitless, making it a powerful tool for anyone looking to streamline and optimize their on-chain processes.

Trustless Hub allows developers and end-users to automate transactions and messages in the Cosmos Ecosystem. Building and interacting with complex automation solutions is also possible. You can build and deploy Self-Executing Smart Contracts using our CosmWasm enginge optimized for automatic exection.


Any protocol with access to Inter-Blockchain communication, like smart contracts on Juno, Osmosis, Secret Network and Archway can extend their functionality through Trustless Hub.

Trustless Hub is built on the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network), and [CosmWasm](CosmWasm.com) - a framework for WASM-compiled smart contracts. CosmWasm is used by many Cosmos SDK Chains. CosmWasm smart contracts can be built safer and are more efficient compared to other smart contract frameworks.


## Use Cases

 1. DeFi
 2. Payments
 3. Gaming

Developers on IBC-enabled blockchains and contract platforms can integrate Trustless Hub's automation solutions. DAOs can use integrate payroll services without requiring a token lock up. NFT creators can integrate time-based minting. Service providers can charge users on a recurring bases, using subscription models. On-chain subscription models are a great way for content creators and website owners to grant accounts access and earn continuous revenue. Games can build in exciting in-game battles with time-based battles and automatic winner appointment.

In the Use Case section we'll dive more into each of these!

## TRST Token

TRST is the native token of Trustless Hub and is used for:

* Automatic execution of smart contract
* Storing, instantiating and executing Contracts
* General transaction fees

You can also stake your TRST by delegating your TRST to validators. You can vote on important proposals such as chain upgrades, fees, incentives and parameter changes.

## Using BFT consensus and Cosmos SDK

Many projects already showcase the Tendermint BFT consensus engine and the Cosmos SDK. Explore the [Cosmos Network Ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps) to discover a wide variety of apps, blockchains, wallets, and explorers that are built in the Cosmos ecosystem.

## Applications
* [TriggerPÃ¸rtal](https://triggerportal.zone) - Schedule payments and trigger automations and across IBC-enabled blockchains
* [Interact Wallet](https://interact.trustlesshub.com) - Wallet interface to send tokens, stake and interact with Trustless Contracts
