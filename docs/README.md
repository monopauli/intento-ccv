# Trustless Hub

[Trustless Hub](https://github.com/trstlabs/trst) is a private smart contract hub within the Cosmos ecosystem. Here you can build and deploy Trustless Contracts to a large decentralized worldwide community. Trustless Hub is built on the [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network), the world’s most popular blockchain framework. Trustless Hub enables new services using private inputs, time-based messages, 1-click recurring execution and verifiable outcomes. Use-cases include recurring swaps for DeFi, 1-click recurring transactions for payment and in-game battles with time-based winner appointment for gaming. 

## What makes automation on Trustless Hub different than using bots?

1. Custom logic with CosmWasm (Fast and secure rust-based framework)
2. We focus on cross-chain apps over IBC
3. Priority in execution over general transactions
4. Fees go to community pool, fostering developement and growth of the ecosystem
5. Proxy contract funds and fees get refunded after execution
6. Instant settlement >1s
7. Encrypted inputs ensure no MEV takes place
8. Easy integration with IBC-enabled contracts
9. Easy to build custom CosmWasm apps with privacy
10. We use CosmWasm, Cosmos's leading smart contract tool

## Why Trustless Contracts?

Smart contracts enable decentralized applications, where data is immutable and users can trust the data to be real and uncensored. Still, smart contracts are far from perfect as current smart contracts on major blockchains are fully public, data is stored indefinitely. Right now, developers cannot guarantee any kind of privacy when interacting with their contracts. Anyone can view user inputs. Users lose funds because smart contracts have no predefined end date. Stakeholders may not develop enough trust to interact with the contract as the data is public and the contract end date is unknown.

Yet, so far no easy way exists to build contracts with private user inputs, deterministic outcomes and automatic time-based actions to cope with these problems.

In order to truly build trustless applications for DAOs and end-users, developers should be able to program contracts that have automatic time-based functions.

Chains and CosmWasm-based apps extend their functionality by integrating with Trustless Hub over IBC. Trustless Contracts enable existing apps to have automatic execution and front-running resistance. Out of the box, recurring transactions, remittances and payroll are possible. With allowance, recipients can interact and transfer funds to a privacy-perserving balance.
 

## 4 pillars of Trustless Contracts

1. Front-running resistance
2. Time-based Execution
3. Recurring transactions with one click
4. Governance-verified Templates

Any CosmWasm code, like smart contracts on Juno, Osmosis, Secret Network and Archway can extend their functionality through Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)., or be transformed into a Trustless Contract.

## Use Cases

Developers on other Chains and contract platforms will be able to use and integrate Trustless Contracts. DAOs can use payroll services, NFT solutions can have subscriptions, and games can do in-game battles with time-based winner appointment. 

1. DeFi - time-based trading strategies
On Trustless Hub, DeFi users can automatically swap tokens dependent on price changes. With AutoSwap users set a strategy for the swapped token. It can be discarded by decreasing allowance or by moving the tokens. With IBC developers can build complex logic for time-based trading across IBC enabled DEXes.

2. Recurring payments with one approval (Remittances / Payroll / Invoices) 
Pay family-members, employees and contractors each day/week/month, without exposing privacy-sensitive data. Recipient can be paid in desired currency and can continuously earn yield. 

3. Gaming
Game developers use encryped inputs, shielded state, time-based execution and instant settlement to create exciting new games. 

In-game ‘fights’ of 2 creatures require players to hide their creature’s strength and health. This data should remain hidden until after the battle finishes. 
Games can also create time-based rewards for the users. For example if the user unlocks a badge and still owns the badge at a certain time, it gets a reward. 

4. Auctions - Private bids, automatic redistribution and private contact detail sharing
Biddings are unknown to all, and private information can be shared to the interested parties. Can end at specific time and funds are then automatically redistributed. 

5. Time-based NFT transfers
Transfer tokens/NFTs at a certain time and when it meets certain conditions. Data about the transfer remains shielded.

Additionally, NFTs can have private characteristics and user data like a phone number and email address attached, to be shared with the buyer.

6. Valuations - private estimations and instant settlement
Estimation data such as the valuation and comments are unknown to all during the estimation period, then made public when the estimation period ends. Estimators can be rewarded based on how close they are to the mean/median of the bids in the private state. 

7. In-private content sharing with micropayment (News sites/Journal/Scientific articles/videos)
Sharing of private knowledge, with a proof recorded on-chain. Contents may be released given certain conditions at a specific date and time.
And much more...

## What is TRST?

TRST is the native token of Trustless Hub and is used to pay for:

* Time-based automatic smart contract execution
* Storing, instantiating and executing Trustless Contracts
* General transactions

You can also stake your TRST by delegating your TRST to validators. Trough governance, you can vote on important proposals such as upgrades and parameter changes. 


## Using BFT consensus and Cosmos SDK

Many projects already showcase the Tendermint BFT consensus engine and the Cosmos SDK. Explore the [Cosmos Network Ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/apps) to discover a wide variety of apps, blockchains, wallets, and explorers that are built in the Cosmos ecosystem.
