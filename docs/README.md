# Trustless Hub

Trustless Hub is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for automation of on-chain processes and enables recurring transfers, time-based strategies, and autonomous services. 
Trustless Hub brings traditional finance features to the DeFi space, allowing users to automate their on-chain processes in a secure manner. The platform offers several advantages over current solutions, such as bot networks, including enhanced efficiency, and the ability to automate assets without locking assets in smart contracts. 

Using the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) and Interchain Accounts industry standards, this allows developers and organizations to create powerful automated services including payroll and subscription services on any IBC-enabled chain whilst keeping balances on that chain.

With Trustless Hub, users can schedule transactions for recurring transfers, subscriptions, trading and asset management in a seamless manner. The platform also enables time-based strategies, such as dollar-cost averaging, for DeFi users while retaining full control of their assets. Additionally, on-chain autonomous agents can perform various functions, such as facilitating transactions and managing assets across time.
