## Use Cases

Developers on other Chains and contract platforms will be able to use and integrate Trustless Hub's WASM Smart Contracts. DAOs can use payroll services, NFT solutions can have subscriptions, and games can do in-game battles with time-based winner appointment. 

### 1. DeFi

On Trustless Hub, contracts can automatically trade dependent on price changes. Trading is done in a front-running resistant and privacy-perserving way,  users are in control of balances transaction history. We've developed a [DeFi Contract bundle](https://github.com/trstlabs/dex-contracts) for developers to integrate with

#### What's possible

* With AutoSwap users set a strategy for the swapped token
* Gradually increase eposure to an asset with Dollar-Cost Averaging 
* Build complex logic for time-based trading across IBC-enabled chains
* DEX aggregators can compare prices are compared between chains and swap accordingly
 

#### Examples

1. DCA Strategy
2. Multichain DEX Aggregator
3. Auto-rebalancing ETFs
4. Conditional Time-based trades

### 2. Payments

Pay family-members, employees and contractors each day/week/month, without exposing privacy-sensitive data. Recipients can be paid in desired currency and can continuously earn yield

With recurring payments on current smart contracts recipients have to claim tokens manually.
By using our contracts users do not need to claim tokens and receive tokens automatically,

#### What's possible

* Send remittances automatically depending on account balance
* Provide Payroll services with programmable privacy
* Create Subscription services

#### Examples

1. Recurring Remittances
2. DAO Payroll 
3. Auto-invest income received
4. Subscriptions with 1 click

### 3. Gaming

Game developers use encryped inputs, shielded state, time-based execution and instant settlement to create exciting new games. 
In-game ‘fights’ of 2 characers require players to hide their creature’s strength and health. This data should remain hidden until after the battle finishes. Games can also create time-based rewards for the users. For example if the user unlocks a badge and still owns the badge at a certain time, it gets a reward

#### What's possible

* In-game battles
* Conditional time-dependent rewards 
* Automatic resolving of outcomes

#### Examples

1. Character-based games
2. Games with privacy requirements like Lotteries, poker and bingo
3. Play-to earn
4. Metaverse

### 4. Other

* Prediction markets that automatically resolve and fund winners
*  Auctions - Private bids, automatic redistribution and private contact detail sharing
Biddings are unknown to all, and private information can be shared to the interested parties. Can end at specific time and funds are then automatically redistributed. 
* Time-based NFT transfers
Transfer tokens/NFTs at a certain time and when it meets certain conditions. Data about the transfer remains shielded.
* Valuations - private estimations and instant settlement
* Automatic claiming of tokens
* In-private content sharing with micropayment (News sites/Journal/Scientific articles/videos)
Sharing of private knowledge, with a proof recorded on-chain. Contents may be released given certain conditions at a specific date and time.
And much more...
