## Use Cases

Developers on other Chains and contract platforms will be able to use and integrate Trustless Hub's WASM Smart Contracts. DAOs can use payroll services, NFT solutions can have subscriptions, and games can do in-game battles with time-based winner appointment. 

### 1. DeFi

On Trustless Hub, contracts can automatically trade dependent on price changes. Trading is done in a front-running resistant and privacy-perserving way,  users are in control of balances transaction history. We've developed a [DeFi Contract bundle](https://github.com/trstlabs/dex-contracts) for developers to integrate with.

| Time-Based Automation Use Cases for DeFi | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Autocompounding Staking Rewards | Automated claiming of staking rewards to token holders on a regular basis, such as weekly or monthly. These can be compounded to earn additional yield.|
 Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) | Automated DCA strategies that invest a fixed amount of funds at regular intervals, reducing the impact of market volatility and potentially improving long-term returns. |
| Automated Rebalancing | Automated portfolio rebalancing based on pre-set criteria, such as market conditions or portfolio weightings, ensuring optimal performance and risk management. |
| Flash Loans | Automated flash loans that take advantage of short-term arbitrage opportunities, allowing users to borrow and repay funds within a single transaction. |
| Automated Options Trading | Automated options trading strategies based on pre-set criteria, such as market conditions or risk management, allowing for efficient and profitable trading. |


### 2. Payments

Pay family-members, employees and contractors each day/week/month, without exposing privacy-sensitive data. Recipients can be paid in desired currency and can continuously earn yield

With recurring payments on current smart contracts recipients have to claim tokens manually.
By integrating with Trustless Hub end-users receive tokens automatically.

| --- | --- |
| Scheduled Payments | Payment systems can be automated to send payments at specific times, such as weekly or monthly, for regular bills or payroll. |
| Subscription Renewals | Payment systems can be automated to renew subscriptions at specific intervals, ensuring that customers continue to have access to a service or product. |
| Pre-Authorized Payments | Customers can pre-authorize recurring payments for services or products, ensuring that payments are made on time and without the need for manual intervention. |
| Escrow Services | Escrow services can be used to hold funds for a specific period of time, ensuring that both parties fulfill their obligations before releasing the funds. |
| Payment Scheduling | Payment systems can be automated to schedule payments in advance, ensuring that payments are made on time even if the payer is unavailable at the time the payment is due. |
| Time-Limited Discounts | Payment systems can offer time-limited discounts or promotional offers, encouraging customers to make a purchase within a specific time frame. |


### 3. Gaming
