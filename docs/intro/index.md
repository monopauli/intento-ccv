# TRST Labs

[Intento](https://github.com/trstlabs/trst) is a set of Cosmos SDK modules developed and maintained by TRST Labs to enable permissionless automation of decentralized applications.  Our `AutoTx` module, which is Cosmos SDK-native, has been under development since early 2023 and serves as a foundation for time-based automation across supported chains. The module abstracts transaction complexities, enhances user liquidity, and offers advanced features like chain-agnostic and interdependent intent triggers. By simplifying asset control and enabling permissionless automation of local Cosmos messages and actions on connected IBC chains through Interchain Accounts and AuthZ grants, our module drives value for the Cosmos Ecosystem. Additionally, it extends automation to EVM chains via bridges like Axelar and Gravity Bridge, eliminating the need for escrow and vault-based protocols. This innovative solution captures value within the wider crypto ecosystem through a novel fee mechanism and on-chain automation mechanism.


## Cosmos Ecosystem

The Cosmos ecosystem is a decentralized network designed to connect various blockchains as part of the 'Internet of blockchains' vision. Buidling a vast, interconnected system of blockchains, each specifically designed to serve a particular use case. Intento is proud to be part of this decentralized community building decentralized infrastructure for a better tomorrow. Intento may take a place in the Cosmos ecosystem as a chain that automates CrossChain Apps for any connected chain.

Blockchains built using the Cosmos stack include: Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, Juno, Secret Network, Evmos, Kava, Injective, Kujira, Noble, Umee & many more


## Our Goals
Our vision for Cosmos is to address the urgent need for innovation and differentiation within the ecosystem. The intent-centric automation module aims to enable intent-centric triggers, abstracts away transactions, enhances user liquidity and accessibility,  and provides novel use cases. By achieving these goals, we can revolutionize transactions, empowering users with greater control and efficiency while fostering a vibrant and differentiated ecosystem.


## IBC - Inter-Blockchain Communication

IBC is an interoperability protocol for communicating all kinds of data between arbitrary state machines.
It is different than other bridges as enables direct chain to chain communication. Hence, it is often referred to as a trustless bridging solution.
The IBC application layer can be used to build a wide range of cross-chain applications, including but not limited to token transfers, passing messages between accounts on two chains, NFT transfers and oracle data feeds.

With Intento you can automate smart contracts easily over IBC. What's more is that you can automate over IBC+Axelar on EVM-chains.
These then too benefit from strong automation. EVM Developers can build automation for end users without the need for locking tokens in vault and escrow smart contracts.


## ABOUT TRST LABS

"Innovating Today for a Better Tomorrow" - Empowering Trustless Solutions & Inclusive Access to Blockchain Services

At our core, we are driven by the pursuit of innovation to create a better future. Through our intent-centric automation module, we are breaking new ground in the realm of **trustless** solutions. By building **non-custodial** on-chain and permissionless solutions **, we empower users to take full control of their assets and transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and enabling** a more secure and transparent ecosystem.

But our mission goes beyond technological advancements. We believe in the power of blockchain technology to **transform lives and uplift communities**. That's why we are committed to building permissionless solutions for all. We recognize that not everyone has equal opportunities or freedom to access and utilize financial services due to oppressive regimes or societal barriers. Our intent-centric automation module opens doors for individuals in these circumstances, allowing them to leverage blockchain technology in a **seamless and empowering** manner.

By enabling minorities and individuals in oppressive regimes to participate in the blockchain revolution, we are fostering **financial inclusion** , empowering individuals to take control of their economic destinies, and promoting a more equitable society. **We envision a future where every person, regardless of their background or location, can access and benefit from decentralized finance**.

We are dedicated to **building a better tomorrow, where trustless solutions and inclusive access are the norm**. Join us on this journey as we work together to shape a future that empowers individuals, strengthens communities, and creates lasting positive change.
