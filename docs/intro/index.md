# TRST Labs

[Trustless Hub](https://github.com/trstlabs/trst) is a smart contract blockchain built by TRST Labs to enable automation ion decentralized applications. Development started after discovering limitations of current smart contracts in early 2021. Before, we were building a chain which would act as a decentralized eBay. With current smart contracts it proved to be impossible to develop as it would be heavily reliant on automation and privacy. To be trusted, the marketplace needs automatic execution in a reliable way.  We solved this problem by building a custom contract engine. This is now optimized and called Trustless Hub, the hub for trustless time-based execution of smart contracts, with programmable privacy.

## Cosmos Ecosystem

The Cosmos ecosystem is a decentralized network designed to connect various blockchains as part of the 'Internet of blockchains' vision. Buidling a vast, interconnected system of blockchains, each specifically designed to serve a particular use case. Trustless Hub is proud to be part of this decentralized community building decentralized infrastructure for a better tomorrow. Trustless Hub takes a place in the Cosmos ecosystem as a chain that automates CrossChain Apps.

Blockchains in Cosmos include: Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, Juno, Secret Network, Evmos, Kava, Injective, Kujira, Circle, Umee & many more

## IBC - Inter-Blockchain Communication

IBC is an interoperability protocol for communicating all kinds of data between arbitrary state machines.
It is different than other bridges as it is direct chain to chain communication. Hence, it is often referred to as a trustless bridge.
The IBC application layer can be used to build a wide range of cross-chain applications, including but not limited to token transfers, passing messages between accounts on two chains, NFT transfers and oracle data feeds.

CosmWasm has integrated IBC in a standardized way making it easy to build CrossChain apps. With Trustless Hub you can automate smart contracts easily over IBC.
