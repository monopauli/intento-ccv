## On-Chain Automation

Because Trustless Hub performs automation on-chain, the caller of the execution is the validator set. Because of this, transfers of assets can be automated.
This is the major difference that Trustless Hub provides compared to other solutions. With Transaction Automation using Interchain Accounts, the caller is a predictable address generated in the IBC protocol. With Contact Automation, the caller is the block that will execute the smart contract, without a transaction being submitted directly.

## Self-Executing contracts

Trustless Contracts can have custom logic with CosmWasm. Effient and secure. 
On Trustless Hub it is possible to build trustless cross-chain dApps over IBC. 
In the block creation process on our chain, automatic execution has priority over general transactions. This allows developers and end users to experience time-based execution in a reliable manner. Execution Fees go to the community, fostering developement and growth of the ecosystem. Funds and fees get refunded after execution. This is not possble in bot networks where rewards go to bot operators. 

On bot networks your trade and information may be read beforehand and used against you. On Trustless Hub's smart contracts, encrypted inputs ensure no MEV takes place before or during execution.

Trustless Hub use CosmWasm, Cosmos's leading smart contract VM. As automation is built-in, automating function calls is simple. Contracts on Trustless Hub can also execute with IBC-enabled contracts on other chains.
