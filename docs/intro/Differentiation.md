## Self-Executing contracts

Trustless Contracts can have custom logic with CosmWasm. Effient and secure. 
On Trustless Hub it is possible to build trustless cross-chain apps over IBC. 
In the block creation process, automatic execution has priority over general transactions. This allows developers and end users to experience reliable time-based execution. Execution Fees go to the community, fostering developement and growth of the ecosystem. Funds and fees get refunded after execution. This is not possble in bot networks where bots take the full reward. Our chain has veryy fast finality, allowing you to have near-instant settlement in less than 1s *(or up to 5s, depends on Testnet results*. 

On bot networks your trade and information may be read beforehand and used against you. On Trustless Hub, Encrypted inputs ensure no MEV takes place

Trustless Hub use CosmWasm, Cosmos's leading smart contract VM. As automation is built-in, automating function calls is simple. Contracts on Trustless Hub can also execute with IBC-enabled contracts on other chains.
