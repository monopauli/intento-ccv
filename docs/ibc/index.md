### Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have the following:

- Basic knowledge of the Cosmos SDK and blockchain development
- A Intento node and a separate blockchain network running on the Cosmos SDK, which may be local Intento chain
- Access to the command line interface (CLI) for both networks
- A text editor for editing configuration files
