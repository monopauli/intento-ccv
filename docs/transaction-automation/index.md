# Introduction

This knowledge base contains information that cover different aspects of automation of transactions on Trustless Hub.

Transaction automation is using AutoTx module, it is a relatively simple time-based automation module as opposed to our advanced contract automation that can handle arbitrary messages

## Advantages of our approach:

+ Easy to integrate into dApps
+ Automation of user funds using AuthZ
+ Schedule multiple messages into one AutoTx that execute after eachother
+ You can depend execution on other transactions
+ No need to integrate with bots
+ Fee funds are  refunded after execution finishes
+ For automation over Interchain Accounts, relayers are incentivized
