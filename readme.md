# Trustless Hub

**Trustless Hub** is a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint and created with [Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport).

## Get started

```
make deb
./init.sh
```

`make deb` makes a package (linux only, with SGX enabled) with dependencies. `./init.sh` initializes and starts the node in development.

## Configure

The node can be configured with `config.yml`. To learn more see the [reference](https://github.com/tendermint/starport#documentation).
